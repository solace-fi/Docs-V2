# Introduction

The DeFi landscape is currently lacking lending markets that accept derivatives such as liquid staking derivatives (LSDs) and yield-bearing tokens as collateral. This limitation not only hampers the potential of derivative tokens within the DeFi ecosystem, but also puts constraints on DeFi users, hindering their ability to fully utilize and explore the benefits of DeFiâ€™s composability.

Solace is designed to address this void in the market and empower users to harness the potential of derivative tokens.

### **What is Solace Protocol?**

Solace introduces veTokenomics on a set of markets across Ajna, purposefully created to accept derivatives as collateral for borrowing ETH (or stablecoins). By implementing this integration, Solace Protocol encourages the influx of liquidity into derivatives lending markets, leading to

1. Increased yield opportunities for ETH suppliers, and
2. Expanding the range of strategies that can be employed with derivative tokens.
