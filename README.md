# Introduction

Within the current DeFi space, there is a clear absence of lending markets that support the collateralization of yield-bearing tokens. It's crucial to note that incorporating such collateralization doesn't introduce any new risks beyond what yield-bearing token holders already encounter. Instead, it enhances the usability of these tokens and unlocks a vast array of opportunities for crafting creative DeFi strategies.

Solace is designed to address this need. By incorporating an optimized liquidation mechanism, Solace allows users to leverage the potential of yield-bearing tokens fully without compromising the stability of the lending system, ultimately contributing to a more robust and efficient DeFi landscape.

## What is Solace?

Solace is a DeFi protocol empowering users with enhanced yield and risk management strategies built on a lending market for derivatives assets.

Solace starts with lending markets for PT (Principal Token) and YT (Yield Token) tokens first introduced by Pendle.fi. It allows enhanced strategies for Lido and Aura users and holders of ETH, stETH, rETH, ankrETH, stafiETH tokens and their derivatives BLP and PT tokens.

## **What is Solace useful for?**

DeFi users and liquidity providers can find on Solace unique opportunities to reach higher efficiency, flexibility and protection of their capital.

_A few examples of available strategies:_

* **Risk Protection Strategy**

Solace Coverage provides risk protection similar to insurance but without the issues associated with DeFi insurance. Users can enjoy coverage without concerns about claims, discretionary voting, and conflicts of interest. Additionally, Solace Coverage provides improved capital efficiency and better economics for a more robust and secure risk protection solution.

* **Leveraged APY through Yield Arbitrage**

One way to maximize returns is by taking advantage of yield discrepancies between different assets.

If Pendle offers a fixed 5% APY on PT-stETH, while the borrow rate for ETH on Solace’s lending market is only 3%, users can deposit PT-stETH as collateral, borrow ETH, swap the borrowed ETH for more PT-stETH, and repeat it up to 5 times (depends on borrow limit), potentially earning a maximum leveraged APY of 10%.

\<aside> 💡 This strategy combines the benefits of depositing a yield-bearing asset and borrowing on lending market, but with the added advantage of the certainty provided by the fixed rate of Pendle’s PT tokens.

* **Leveraging Short Yield**

This strategy is for users who believe the current fixed yield on Pendle is overvalued. By using PT-tokens as collateral to borrow ETH and subsequently purchasing more PT-tokens, a user can effectively short yield. If the fixed yield decreases, a user can close their position by selling PT to repay the borrowed ETH, thereby realizing a profit.

* **Leveraging Long Assets with Fixed Yield**

Users who maintain a bullish long-term outlook on a particular asset can leverage their position while simultaneously earning a fixed yield. For instance, a long-term ETH holder can use PT-stETH as collateral to borrow stablecoins and acquire more PT-stETH. This strategy allows users to earn a fixed APY from PT while benefiting from leveraged exposure to their preferred asset (e.g., ETH).
