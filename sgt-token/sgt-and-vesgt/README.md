# SGT and veSGT

Solace protocol uses ve-token (vote escrowed) model, similar to veBAL presented by Balancer. This model allows to involve and reward stakeholders in a fair and capital-efficient manner.

**SGT** is a governance token. Its key role is to incentivize liquidity suppliers on listed Ajna lending pools.

#### **veSGT**

SGT has two main uses: voting and boosting. Both of these require users to first lock (commonly it’s called “vote-lock”). Vote escrowed SGT are non-transferable tokens representing BPT (SGT80/ETH20) locked up to 1 year. The longer it is locked for, the more veSGT a user receives.
