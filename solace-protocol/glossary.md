* **Solace Lending Module**

The Lending Module, a fork of Compound V2, serves as the core mechanism in the Solace protocol. This unique money market enables the collateralization of yield-bearing tokens, creating an array of strategies for DeFi users to manage risk and optimize yield. Among these strategies is the Solace Coverage Module, designed to provide an efficient means of risk hedging across DeFi ecosystem.

* **Solace Coverage Module**

A crucial component of the Solace protocol that allows users to safeguard their DeFi positions. By depositing yield-bearing tokens into the module, users secure a predetermined payout, providing a shield against market uncertainties. This process is conducted within the Solace system, assuring users of both liquidity and security.

* **Yield-Bearing Token:**

A token that generates yield, such as stETH, GLP, gDAI, or liquidity tokens like Aura rETH-WETH.

* **Pendle Protocol:**

Pendle is a decentralized protocol that facilitates the tokenization and trading of future yield generated by various DeFi protocols.

* **SY (Standardized Yield):**

SY is a token standard (EIP-5115) introduced by the Pendle team. It wraps any yield-bearing token, providing a standardized interface for interacting with its yield generation mechanism. Users do not directly interact with SY.

* **PT (Principal Token):**

PT represents the principal amount of the underlying yield-bearing token. It is redeemable after a specific maturity period. PTs can be traded at any time, even before maturity.

* **YT (Yield Token):**

YT entitles the holder to the real-time yield generated by the underlying yield-bearing token. Users can manually claim the accrued yield from the Pendle Dashboard. YT tokens can be traded at any time, even before maturity.

* **Maturity:**

Maturity refers to the date when PT becomes fully redeemable for the underlying asset, and YT stops accruing yield. Each asset may have multiple maturity dates, with independent markets for each date. The implied yield and market dynamics can vary across different maturities.

* **Underlying APY (Annual Percentage Yield):**

Underlying APY represents the 7-day moving average yield rate of the underlying asset. This approach provides a more accurate indication of the underlying yield over a specific time period, assisting traders in estimating the Future Average Underlying APY.
