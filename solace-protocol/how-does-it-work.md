2. Every Supplier can then stake their LPB token (Ajnaâ€™s Liquidity Provider Balance) on Solace to earn SGT emission.
3. Suppliers can also get veSGT by locking their SGT liquidity tokens (SGT80/ETH20 BPT) to control SGT emission across the markets, boosting their own SGT rewards, along with receiving governance powers.

#### For Borrowers on Ajna

1. To become a Borrower, a User borrows on one of the markets on Ajna.
2. Every Borrower gains an opportunity to leverage one of the enhanced strategies: Yield Arbitrage or Hedge Against DeFi risks (Coverage).
