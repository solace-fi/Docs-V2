# Governance process

SolaceDAO has established a three-step process for submitting proposals to ensure that the community has a clear and transparent process for proposing and implementing changes to the protocol.

The steps for a successful governance proposal are:

1. Create a Solace Request for Comments (SRC) and share it on the forum to gauge sentiment and preferences before submitting a formal proposal.
2. Prepare a Solace Improvement Proposal (SIP) along with the necessary payloads for on-chain execution. The SIP should include a motivation section outlining the reason for the proposal, an English specification describing exactly what the proposal will change and its effects on the protocol or treasury balance, and a risk assessment section outlining potential risks to the protocol.
3. Submit the SIP to the protocol for a governance vote.

If successful, the SIP will be executed and implemented by the Multisig.
