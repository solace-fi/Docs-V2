# Overview

Solace on-chain Governance allows token holders to participate in the protocol development, control protocol variables and influence all the key decisions.

This ensures the protocol can rapidly adjust to changing market conditions, as well as upgrade core parts of the protocol as time goes on, while maintaining a sufficient level of decentralization.

### **Governance Power**

SGT and/or veSGT token holders receive governance powers proportionally to the sum of their balance.

There are initially two powers associated with the governance token:

* **Proposal power** that gives access to creating and sustaining a proposal.
* **Voting power** which is used to vote for or against existing proposals.

### **Solace DAO Multisig**

Solace Multisig is a group of community-elected individuals or entities who are part of a SolaceDAO multisig. The multisig is intended to execute decisions made by SGT holders through snapshot voting. This council uses a Gnosis Safe Multisig to execute decisions on-chain, ensuring that the changes are implemented securely and efficiently. The council also provides support to community members throughout the governance process.

The Multisig signers are elected for 12 months by the community and have 9 members with 5 signatures needed to execute a transaction on-chain.

### **DAO Multisig election process**

1. **Nomination Phase (Duration: 1 week)**

The nomination phase allows SGT holders to nominate themselves or other community members as candidates for the multisig signer council. Users can submit their applications in a standardized format in a special channel on Discord, including information on their experience, expertise, and contributions to the Solace ecosystem. &#x20;

2. **Nominee Vetting (Duration: 1 week)**

Once the nomination phase is complete, the Multisig signers review the nominees based on the information provided in their applications. They create a shortlist of candidates for the multisig signer council, ensuring transparency by publishing the vetting criteria and the rationale behind the shortlisted candidates on a publicly accessible platform.&#x20;

3. **Community Discussion (Duration: runs parallel to the Nominee Vetting process)**

During the community discussion phase, the Solace community have the opportunity to voice their opinions, provide feedback and share their thoughts on the shortlisted candidates. The Multisig signers are in contact with the nominees and can share their findings/opinions on a running basis. This runs parallel to the nominee vetting process.&#x20;

4. **Approval of the Final List of Multisig Signers (Duration: a few days)**

Once the Multisig signers and community discussion phase is complete, each candidate is voted on separately by SGT holders via snapshot votes. If a candidate receives a sufficient number of votes, they are selected as a multisig signer.
