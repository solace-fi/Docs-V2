# Gauge voting

A gauge is a smart contract that helps to measure how much value a user is providing to a lending pool.

_**The weight system**_

Each gauge has its weight. The weight represents how much of the daily SGT emission will be received by the gauge (i.e. lending pool).

veSGT holders can vote for one or multiple gauges, choosing which pools SGT emission should be directed to. veSGT holders vote on gauges once every 10 days.
