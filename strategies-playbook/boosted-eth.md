# Boosted ETH

To effectively double ETH rewards, a user should provide ETH to one of the curated pools on Ajna.&#x20;

By doing so, they can increase their reward rate, receiving both lending fees and SGT emission. Once the ETH is deposited, the user should stake their Ajna's NFT on Solace to start earning additional rewards in SGT tokens. Users can further amplify their rewards by considering the option to lock their SGT tokens. This not only boosts rewards even more but also grants users control over SGT emission across various markets via voting.
